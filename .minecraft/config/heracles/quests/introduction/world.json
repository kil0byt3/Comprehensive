      "",
      "This modpack has SO many ways to travel around the world - /4/except for teleporting/4/! There are no forms of teleportation that players can access - instead, /6/Comprehensive/6/ focuses on giving freedom to players to form their own supply lines. ",

      "The /6/Supply Cart/6/ is simply a double chest worth of inventory space. A friend can also ride on the back! ",
      "The /6/Plow/6/ lets you automatically till farmland, or create paths, by putting hoes or shovels, respectively, in the inventory! It can be toggled with a Right-Click. ",
      "The /6/Animal Cart/6/ allows two players OR mobs to ride in the back - the perfect way to bring some cows home to start a farm. To load a mob in, just drive the cart near them. ",

      "&&7[Small Ships]&&r adds various types of /d/larger boats/d/ that can both hold a lot of inventory, but also more players, and move a lot faster than a normal boat due to having sails! If you live on a River or near an Ocean, definitely take a look in your REI at what these ships have to offer.",

      "&&7[Audaki/Create]&&r For a game called Minecraft, we don't end up using &&aMinecarts&&r very much in vanilla! That's why we have both massively increased speed capability for Minecarts, AND the ability to link carts together to form cart trains using a /a/Minecart Coupling/a/. Try using them in your mines!",

      "&&7[Create: Trains]&&r The Create mod is far too amazing and expansive to describe here, but one of its most wonderful features is the ability to create train tracks and fully custom block-built &&aTrains&&r. A smart engineer could use Create features like the Mechanical Drill and Roller to form train lines and bridges across the land to connect population centres. (Hint! Create has other great ways of getting around, too - check out the /3/Elevator Pulley/3/!)",

      "&&7[Immersive Aircraft]&&r Flight! Once you progress through the /6/Create/6/ mod sufficiently, you will be able to craft various types of aerial transportation. These range from the personal /9/Jetpack/9/, mostly good for building, to the slow but high-capacity /9/ Cargo Airship/9/, to the fast but dangerous /9/Biplane/9/. Keep in mind that there are many upgrades that can be applied to your flying machines to make them faster or easier to turn/land - however, keep an eye on that fuel!",
